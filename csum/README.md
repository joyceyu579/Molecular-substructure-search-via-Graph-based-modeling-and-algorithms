## Repository Contents
This repository contains 4 files used to run the compensated (Kahan) sum program: 
`KahanSum.cpp`, `KahanSum.hpp`, `KahanSum.tpp`, `main.cpp`


## How to use repository contents
<b>To use the cpp program implementing compensated/Kahan sum</b>, the user must first ensure they have access to the appropriate files found in the `csum` subdirectory. This subdirectory includes 4 files: `KahanSum.cpp`, `KahanSum.hpp`, `KahanSum.tpp`, and `main.cpp`. The user may use the `main.cpp` file for their calculations. They may find code that is already written in `main.cpp`. However, the user does not have to worry about the code that already exists in `main.cpp` as it was used for testing purposes by the programmer to ensure the program runs as expected. Looking pass the testcases, the user may create and enter a container of ordered long doubles (that does not consider uniqueness of elements) that they wish to compute the sum of into `main.cpp` under `int main(void)` and before `return 0`. After creating a container with values to sum, they may call the function KahanSum() (and RegularSum() for comparison) and pass their container type into the functions. The program already considers passing the parameter by reference, so the user does not need to worry about using an extra `&`. To compile and run the code, and assuming the user is in the appropriate folder path, the user needs to type into the terminal: 
```
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp KahanSum.cpp -o executible
./executible
```


## C++ (Kahan Sum) Reflection
This program uses 4 files: `KahanSum.cpp`, `KahanSum.hpp`, `KahanSum.tpp`, and `main.cpp`.
The declaration and implementation of the methods `KahanSum()` and `RegularSum()` can be found in `KahanSum.tpp` . Both methods are templated to allow users to compute a sum of numbers found in an ordered container that doesn't require all elements to be unique. Templated functions are stored inside `.tpp` files. However, only `.cpp` files can be compiled. This led me to treat `KahanSum.tpp` very similar to other libraries that are only included and specified in the `.hpp` header files. When the file is called to compile through `g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp KahanSum.cpp -o executiblename`, the C++ programming language will look for main and read in necesary `#includes` through the `.hpp` header file. The compiler will then see the function call in `main.cpp`, then the specified datatype (i.e. vector, list, array, etc.), then looks to the templated function found in the `.tpp` file, and replaces the keyword and generic type `template` and `T` with the specified datatype name (CHEM274A week 6 material). These 2 templated functions were designed to pass the container type in by reference. The container does not get modified inside the function, and passing by reference avoids creating unecessary copies of the container in memory. In addition, const was added to the beginning of each function declaration to make the return value of the functions constant and unchangeable once computed for future use (CHEM274A week 2 and 5 discussion material). These 2 functions also use iterators to iterate through each container. Using iterators is more versatile than using for loops, and allows us to iterate through different container types which is most suitable for implementing function templates capable of working with different containers (CHEM274A week 8 material.) Bounds checking is implemented in the 2 templated functions to ensure that our iterator starts adding to the beginning of the container where the largest value should be located.
